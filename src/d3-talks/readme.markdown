**What it is d3?**

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring the data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.
